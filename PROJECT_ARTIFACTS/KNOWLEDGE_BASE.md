## How do Large Language Models process and store audio?

This is a very insightful question that gets to the heart of how modern AI handles data beyond text. You're right to connect it to tokens, but the process for audio is a bit more complex than a simple "sound byte per token" mapping.

Here’s a breakdown of the process, moving from the raw audio to the tokens an LLM can understand.

### The Core Problem: Audio is a Continuous Wave

Unlike text, which is already divided into discrete units (characters, words), raw audio is a continuous analog signal. When we digitize it, it becomes a **waveform**: a long sequence of numbers (samples) representing the air pressure at tiny intervals.

*   A single second of CD-quality audio has 44,100 samples.
*   This is a massive "firehose" of data. It's too dense and unstructured for a language model to process efficiently. A model trying to find patterns in raw samples would be like trying to read a book by analyzing the molecular structure of the ink.

### The Solution: From Waveform to Discrete Tokens

To solve this, models use a two-step process to convert the continuous waveform into a sequence of discrete tokens, much like text tokens.

#### Step 1: Create a Visual Representation (The Spectrogram)

First, the raw waveform is converted into a **spectrogram**.

*   **What it is:** A spectrogram is essentially an "image of sound." It plots **frequency** against **time**, with the color or intensity of each point representing the amplitude (loudness) of a specific frequency at a specific moment.
*   **Why it's useful:** This representation is much more meaningful. It makes patterns like phonemes, notes, and background noise visually distinct, similar to how letters form words on a page. Most state-of-the-art audio models (like OpenAI's Whisper) don't "listen" to the audio directly; they "look" at its spectrogram.

Think of it like this:
*   **Waveform:** A single, messy line of seismic data from an earthquake.
*   **Spectrogram:** A clear chart showing the earthquake's P-waves and S-waves over time.

#### Step 2: "Tokenize" the Spectrogram

Now that we have a structured representation (the spectrogram), we need to convert it into a sequence of discrete tokens. This is where the real magic happens, using a specialized component often called an **audio encoder** or **tokenizer**.

This isn't a simple one-to-one mapping. Instead, the model learns to recognize fundamental "sound concepts" from the spectrogram. The most common technique is called **Vector Quantization (VQ)**.

Here’s an analogy for how it works:

1.  **The "Dictionary of Sounds" (Codebook):** The model is pre-trained with a "codebook," which is like a dictionary containing a few thousand entries. Each entry isn't a word, but a vector representing a tiny, fundamental snippet of sound (like a specific vowel sound, a consonant transition, a type of hiss, or a piece of a musical note).

2.  **Slicing the Spectrogram:** The model looks at the spectrogram in small, overlapping windows or "patches."

3.  **Finding the Closest Match:** For each patch of the spectrogram, the model calculates its vector representation and compares it to all the entries in the "dictionary of sounds."

4.  **Assigning the Token:** It finds the closest match in the dictionary and uses the **index** of that match as the token. For example, if a patch of sound strongly matches the 512th entry in the dictionary, the token for that patch is `512`.

### Summary: The Final Answer

So, to answer your question directly: **it is not one sound byte per token.**

Instead, it's more like **one abstract, learned "sound concept" per token.**

The full pipeline is:
**Raw Audio Waveform** -> **Spectrogram (Image of Sound)** -> **Sequence of Tokens** (where each token is an ID pointing to a learned sound-vector in a dictionary).

This sequence of tokens is what the Large Language Model finally processes. It allows the model to handle audio with the same powerful Transformer architecture it uses for text, enabling it to perform tasks like transcription, translation, or even generating entirely new audio.

## Why can't we predict timestamp reduction per deleted word?

That's exactly right. Your insight gets to the core challenge—and a key design decision—of this entire application.

**There is no reliable way to predict the time saved by deleting a single word.**

Here’s why, building on our discussion of tokens:

1.  **Words Are Not Uniform Audio Blocks:** The word "I" might take 150 milliseconds to say, while the word "spectrogram" might take 800 milliseconds. The time saved depends entirely on the specific word's duration in the original audio.

2.  **Cadence and Pauses:** The time associated with a word also includes the silence around it. Consider these two phrases:
    *   `"and then I..."` (spoken quickly)
    *   `"...and... then I..."` (spoken hesitantly)
    Deleting the word "and" from each phrase would result in a different amount of time saved because the second version includes a pause. The text is identical, but the audio is not.

3.  **Co-articulation (Sound Bleeding):** In natural speech, the sounds of words bleed into each other. The end of "word" and the beginning of "one" are not separate, clean-cut audio events. The audio tokens represent these messy, blended sounds, not neat word boundaries. Trying to surgically remove just the audio for "word" is imprecise and often results in unnatural-sounding cuts.

### How `shutri` Is Designed to Solve This

This is precisely why `shutri`'s editing model is based on **clips**, not individual words.

The transcription service (Gemini) provides a chunk of text with a corresponding start and end time. This becomes a single, editable line in the `.shutri` file:

`[00:31.500] ...and from there I moved to the city. [00:36.900]`

The `shutri` workflow is built around this structure:

*   **Deleting:** When you delete this entire line, you are not deleting words; you are deleting a **known time segment**. The time saved is precisely `36.900 - 31.500 = 5.4` seconds. There is no prediction involved.
*   **Fine-tuning:** If you want to effectively "delete a word" from that clip, you don't just remove the text. You would **adjust the timestamps**. For example, to remove "...and from there", you would listen to the clip, find the exact time the word "I" starts (e.g., `00:33.100`), and change the `start_time`:

    `[00:33.100] I moved to the city. [00:36.900]`

You then use the playback feature (`<Leader>P`) to instantly hear the result of your change and confirm the timing is right.

In short, `shutri` sidesteps the impossible task of predicting time-from-word by making the **timestamps themselves** the primary object of the edit. The text is just a human-readable reference for what's happening during that time.

## Architectural Decision: Why Use Rust as an Intermediary for Playback?

A valid architectural question is: "Why call a Rust binary for playback instead of having Vim call `sox` directly?" While a direct call is possible for simple cases, the Rust intermediary is a deliberate design choice to enhance maintainability, reduce latency on complex operations, and ensure a portable API.

### 1. Managing Complexity

The core reason is to centralize complex logic. While playing a single clip is straightforward, consider the **"Play Edited Chunk"** feature. A pure Vimscript implementation would be responsible for:
1.  Identifying the correct lines in the buffer for the current chunk.
2.  Looping through each line.
3.  Parsing timestamps from each line.
4.  Calling `sox` to extract each clip into a separate temporary file.
5.  Calling `sox` again to concatenate all temporary files.
6.  Playing the final concatenated file.
7.  Cleaning up all temporary files.

This level of data processing, file I/O, and process management is difficult to implement, debug, and maintain in Vimscript. By delegating this to a compiled Rust binary, the Vim plugin remains simple and focused. The Rust environment is faster, strongly typed, and far better suited for these tasks.

### 2. Minimizing Latency

While adding a process call introduces a tiny overhead, it results in **lower overall latency** for complex, multi-clip operations.
*   **Simple Playback (e.g., Play Clip):** The startup time of the small, compiled Rust binary is negligible (a few milliseconds) and is not a bottleneck compared to the time `sox` takes to process the audio.
*   **Complex Playback (e.g., Play Edited Chunk):** An interpreted language like Vimscript performing the complex orchestration described above would be significantly slower than the highly optimized, compiled Rust code executing the same logic.

Therefore, the Rust layer makes the most critical preview feature much faster.

### 3. Ensuring a Stable, Portable API

The `shutri` command-line interface (`shutri --play-clip "..."`, `shutri --play-edited-chunk "..."`, etc.) serves as a stable, well-defined API for the core audio engine. This is a key principle of the project.

If we decide to create a plugin for a different editor (e.g., VS Code, Neovim with Lua), we would only need to write a small extension that calls this same, simple command-line API. If the core logic were embedded in Vimscript, it would need to be completely rewritten and maintained for each new editor, which is not a scalable approach.

In summary, the Rust intermediary is a strategic choice that prioritizes maintainability, performance on complex tasks, and future portability, at the negligible cost of a few milliseconds of startup time for simple commands.
