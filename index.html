                    text: `<p>Verse 1:<br>Dhṛtarāṣṭra inquired, his words taking flight,<br>O Sañjaya, tell, after assembling for the fight,<br>My sons and those of Pāṇḍu, on Kurukṣetra's sacred ground,<br>What deeds unfolded there, what actions could be found?</p><p>Verse 2:<br>Sañjaya then spoke, his voice serene and deep,<br>O King (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), Duryodhana, his watchful vigil to keep,<br>Observed the Pāṇḍava force, in battle lines arrayed,<br>And to his trusted teacher (Droṇa), these very words he conveyed.</p><p>Verse 3:<br>O my respected guru (Droṇa), did Duryodhana declare,<br>Behold the mighty army, beyond compare,<br>Of Pāṇḍu's noble sons, so skillfully aligned,<br>By your own brilliant student, of Drupada's mind.</p><p>Verse 4:<br>Within this grand formation, brave archers stand with might,<br>As strong as Bhīma, Arjuna, prepared to fiercely fight.<br>Great warriors also gather: Yuyudhāna, bold and true,<br>With Virāṭa and Drupada, a valiant, noble crew.</p><p>Verse 5:<br>And heroes strong and potent, their prowess well-renowned,<br>Like Dhṛṣṭaketu, Cekitāna, on battlefields are found.<br>With Kāśirāja, Purujit, and Kuntibhoja brave,<br>And Śaibya, ready for the war, their lives they freely gave.</p><p>Verse 6:<br>The mighty Yudhāmanyu, of strength that knows no end,<br>With Uttamaujā powerful, their loyal support they lend.</p><p>Verse 7:<br>But for your kind attention, O Brahmin of great fame,<br>The captains of my forces, I shall now distinctly name,<br>Those specially qualified, their leadership to show,<br>To guide our mighty warriors, wherever they may go.</p><p>Verse 8:<br>There are such noble figures, like you, revered and wise,<br>With Bhīṣma, Karṇa, Kṛpa, whose valor never dies.</p><p>Verse 9:<br>And many other heroes, with courage burning bright,<br>Prepared to sacrifice their lives, for me and for my right.<br>With weapons armed, and skill in warfare keen,<br>In military science, their expertise has been.</p><p>Verse 10:<br>Our strength is vast, unmeasured, a boundless, surging tide,<br>By Grandfather Bhīṣma protected, our forces stand with pride.<br>But the strength of the Pāṇḍavas, though guarded by Bhīma's hand,<br>Is limited and finite, across this sacred land.</p><p>Verse 11:<br>(Duryodhna addressing his ranks at large)<br>Now, all of you assembled, your steadfast support must lend,<br>To Grandfather Bhīṣma's guidance, your energies extend.</p><p>Verse 12:<br>Then Bhīṣma, grandsire valiant, of Kuru's noble race,<br>The grandfather of warriors, in that momentous place,<br>Blew his great conchshell loudly, a lion's mighty roar,<br>And filled Duryodhana's spirit with joy unknown before.</p><p>Verse 13:<br>Then conchshells and kettle drums, with bugles, trumpets high,<br>And horns resounded suddenly, throughout the earth and sky.</p><p>Verse 14:<br>Upon the other side then, their conchshells did resound,<br>Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, on chariot holy ground,<br>Drawn by white steeds of glory, their sacred duty bound,<br>Their transcendental instruments, their victory did propound.</p><p>Verse 15:<br>Lord Kṛṣṇa blew His Pāñcajanya, a sound divine and grand,<br>Arjuna blew Devadatta, across the waiting land.</p><p>Verses 16-18:<br>King Yudhiṣṭhira, Kuntī's son, his Ananta-vijaya blew,<br>Nakula and Sahadeva, their Sughoṣa, strong and new,<br>And Maṇipuṣpaka sounded, a vibrant, echoing call.<br>The archer King of Kāśī, renowned by one and all,<br>Śikhaṇḍī, mighty fighter, with Dhṛṣṭadyumna near,<br>And Virāṭa, unconquerable, dispelling every fear.</p><p>Verse 19:<br>The blowing of these conchshells, a clamorous, rising tide,<br>Vibrating through the heavens, and earth on every side.</p><p>Verse 20:<br>Then Arjuna, son of Pāṇḍu, in his chariot did reside,<br>His banner marked with Hanumān, with valor and with pride.<br>He took his mighty bow then, and arrows made him ready,<br>And seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons, his voice grew firm and steady.</p><p>Verses 21-22:<br>Arjuna spoke, O Krishna, infallible and true,<br>Pray draw my chariot forward, these armies to review.<br>Between the ranks of battle, let it swiftly glide,<br>That I may see those present, who have come to fight with pride,<br>And those with whom in this great war, my strength I must employ,<br>In this momentous trial of arms, where fates we shall deploy.</p><p>Verse 23:<br>Let me behold those warriors, who gather on this field,<br>With hearts intent on battle, their destinies revealed.<br>Those who have come to please him, the evil-minded one,<br>The son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, whose wicked deeds are done.</p><p>Verse 24:<br>Sañjaya then recounted, to Bharata's noble line,<br>Lord Kṛṣṇa, by Arjuna's words, did swiftly now incline.</p><p>Verse 25:<br>He drove the splendid chariot, with skill beyond compare,<br>Right in the midst of armies, suspended in the air.</p><p>Verse 26:<br>There Arjuna then witnessed, a sight that caused him pain,<br>Within the opposing forces, again and yet again,<br>His fathers, grandfathers present, teachers of great skill,<br>Maternal uncles, brothers too, his heart began to chill.</p><p>Verse 27:<br>When Kuntī's noble son, Arjuna, cast his gaze,<br>On all these different kinsmen, in battle's fierce displays,<br>His heart was overwhelmed with compassion's gentle sway,<br>And thus to Lord Kṛṣṇa, these words he did convey.</p><p>Verse 28:<br>Arjuna said, O Kṛṣṇa dear, as I behold this sight,<br>My friends and close relations, prepared to fiercely fight,<br>The limbs upon my body, begin to quake and reel,<br>And in my parched and anxious mouth, no moisture can I feel.</p><p>Verse 29:<br>My very frame is trembling, my hair stands on its end,<br>The Gāṇḍīva, my mighty bow, its grip I can't defend,<br>It slips from my weakening hand, my skin with fever burns,<br>As dread and apprehension, to every nerve returns.</p><p>Verse 30:<br>I cannot stand here longer, my strength has ebbed away,<br>My memory is fading, in this distressing day.<br>Misfortune's signs surround me, O Kṛṣṇa, slayer of the foe,<br>In this impending conflict, where seeds of sorrow grow.</p><p>Verse 31:<br>No good can I envision, from slaying my own kin,<br>In this destructive battle, where loss will soon begin.<br>Nor can I wish for victory, or kingdom's fleeting claim,<br>Nor happiness that follows, this act of cruelest aim.</p><p>Verses 32-35:<br>O Govinda, tell me truly, of what avail to me,<br>Are kingdom, joy, or even life, in this calamity?<br>When those for whom we long , stand ready here to die,<br>O Madhusūdana, as moments swiftly fly.<br>Our teachers, fathers, grandsons, maternal uncles too,<br>And fathers-in-law assembled, a sorrowful review.<br>Brothers-in-law and kinsmen, prepared to face their fate,<br>To give up life and fortune, before my eyes they wait.</p><p>Verse 36:<br>Sin will surely overcome us, if we these men should slay,<br>These aggressors who confront us, upon this fateful day.<br>Therefore it is not proper, to spill their precious blood,<br>What gain, O Kṛṣṇa, husband of fortune's gentle flood?<br>How could we find true happiness, by kin's untimely end,<br>On this Kurukṣetra battlefield, where sorrows now descend?</p><p>Verses 37-38:<br>O Janārdana, though these men, by greed's dark force possessed,<br>See no fault in family strife, or friendships dispossessed,<br>Why should we, who clearly see, the crime of family's fall,<br>Engage in such vile actions, and answer to sin's call?</p><p>Verse 39:<br>With the destruction of the clan, tradition fades away,<br>The ancient family customs, in utter disarray.<br>And when the dynasty is lost, and ancient ways are gone,<br>The rest of the afflicted house, in irreligion is drawn.</p><p>Verse 40:<br>When irreligion flourishes, O Kṛṣṇa, dark and deep,<br>The women of the household, their purity can't keep.<br>And from this degradation, O Vṛṣṇi's noble heir,<br>Unwanted progeny arises, causing deep despair.</p><p>Verse 41:<br>An increase in unwanted births, brings hellish life's domain,<br>To families and those who break, tradition's binding chain.</p><p>Verse 42:<br>By evil deeds committed, by those who wreck the clan,<br>And cause the birth of unwanted ones, a most unholy plan,<br>All community projects fail, and welfare's gentle hand,<br>And family's cherished harmony, are ruined across the land.</p><p>Verse 43:<br>O Kṛṣṇa, sustainer of all, the people's guiding light,<br>Through disciplic succession, I've heard with all my might,<br>That those whose family customs, are utterly destroyed,<br>Forever in the hellish realms, their wretchedness employed.</p><p>Verse 44:<br>Alas, how strange this seems to me, that we are now prepared,<br>To perpetrate such sinful acts, our conscience unprepared.<br>Driven by the craving for a kingdom's fleeting bliss,<br>We stand intent on killing, our own dear kith and kiss.</p><p>Verse 45:<br>Better for me if Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons, with weapons in their hold,<br>Should slay me unarmed, unresisting, my story to be told,<br>Upon this field of battle, where fates will soon align,<br>Than I should raise my hand against, this family of mine.</p><p>Verse 46:<br>Sañjaya then recounted, Thus spoke Arjuna brave,<br>Upon the Kurukṣetra field, where warriors sought their grave.<br>He cast aside his mighty bow, with arrows sharp and keen,<br>And sank down on his chariot, with sorrow's painful scene,<br>His mind overwhelmed with anguish, his spirit filled with grief,<br>As war's grim reality, brought him no relief.</p>`

Madhusūdana, these words were then addressed .</p><p>Verse 2:<br>The Lord then said, with voice serene and clear,<br>O Arjuna, how has this defilement come so near?<br>Unworthy of a soul that knows life's precious worth,<br>It leads to shame, and not to realms of higher birth .</p><p>Verse 3:<br>Yield not to weakness, son of Pṛthā's line,<br>This impotence degrades, it is not truly thine.<br>Discard this petty faintness of the heart's domain,<br>Arise, O chastiser of foes, and conquer again .</p><p>Verse 4:<br>Arjuna then replied, with troubled, earnest plea,<br>O killer of all foes, and Madhu's enemy,<br>How can I strike with arrows sharp and keen,<br>At Bhīṣma, Droṇa, whom I should hold in esteem?</p><p>Verse 5:<br>To beg for life would be a kinder fate,<br>Than living at

Your light, instruct me right .</p><p>Verse 8:<br>No solace can I find, no comfort can I see,<br>To dry the tears that flow so endlessly.<br>Not even if a kingdom vast I should attain,<br>Like gods in heaven, still this grief would stain .</p><p>Verse 9:<br>Sañjaya then spoke, his narrative to bind,<br>Thus Arjuna said, his troubled soul entwined.</p><p>Verse 10:<br>'O Govinda, I shall not fight, ' his final word did cease,<br>And in the chariot's stillness, he found no release .<br>O Bharata's descendant, in that martial scene,<br>With gentle smile, Kṛṣṇa then intervened.<br>Between the waiting armies, His wisdom to impart,<br>To grief-struck Arjuna, He spoke from His great heart .</p><p>Verse 11:<br>The Lord proclaimed, His words like nectar's flow,<br>Though wisdom's language from your lips does go,<br>You mourn for that which merits not your tear.<br>The truly wise hold neither dead nor living dear .</p><p>Verse 12:<br>There never was a time when I did cease to be,<br>Nor you, nor these assembled kings, for all eternity.<br>And in the ages yet to come, this truth shall still remain,<br>That none of us will ever fade or wane .</p><p>Verse 13:<br>As through this life the embodied soul will stride,<br>From childhood's dawn to youth, then age's tide,<br>So at death's door, a new form it will find.<br>The wise are not by such transitions blind .</p><p>Verse 14:<br>O son of Kuntī,

who stands unmoved and bold,<br>By happiness or sorrow's touch controlled,<br>Who keeps his balance, steady and serene,<br>That soul, O Arjuna, is fit for freedom's sheen .</p><p>Verse 16:<br>The seers of truth, their wisdom deep and vast,<br>Have known the unreal's end, the real's firm cast.<br>The body's fleeting form will surely fade away,<br>But the eternal soul will never know decay .</p><p>Verse 17:<br>Know that which through the entire being spreads,<br>Is indestructible, beyond all dreads.<br>No force can ever shatter or subdue,<br>The imperishable soul that dwells in you

A Yogi true a Sannyasi bold! No hearth's warm glow.<br>No outward deed alone. But inward fire. A spirit keenly sown.</p><p>Verse 6-2. For Sannyasa, a name of solemn sound. Is Yoga's self, Where fancy's webs are torn.<br>No dreamer he, on shifting wishes bound. A Yogi wakes when such desires are mourn. To quell the heart's unceasing wild unrest.<br>This is the mark, the deeply cherished test.</p><p>Verse 6-3. Who seeks Yoga's height. Where rapturous peace doth gleam. By action's wing must first his soul be borne. But when that airy summit like a dream.<br>Is reached at last. And worldly storms are sworn to silence. Then Serenity divine.<br>Shall on his spirit, ceaselessly recline.</p><p>Verse 6-4. When sense no more a silken thread doth bind. Nor deeds entangle in their mystic maze. And selfish longings vanish. Leaving mind as starlit heaven, On quiet summer days.<br>Then Yogarudha, bathed in purest light. Stands firm and free from passion's fading blight.</p><p>Verse 6-5. By thine own soul. Lift up thy languid gaze. Lest in the mire thy spirit lose its worth.<br>For self can prove a sun in life's dark haze. Or serpent coiling in thy bosom's girth.</p><p>Verse 6-6. The self as friend. A balm for every smart. When by the self the wayward self is tamed.<br>But ah. To him who fails this crucial art. The very self.<br>A foe with fury flamed.</p><p>Verse 6-7. The conquered soul. where gentle quiet dwells. In Highest Self a kindred essence spies. Through summer's blaze and winter's icy spells.<br>Through praise that lifts and scorn that darkly lies.</p><p>Verse 6-8. With wisdom's draught his spirit doth refine. Unwavering. Senses held in soft control. To him are kin the shard.<br>The golden shine. A harmonized and consecrated soul.</p><p>Verse 6-9. To friend. To foe. A heart that knows no gall.<br>To neutral gaze. To hatred's bitter sting. To kindly kin.<br>Where gentle graces fall. Or wrongful hand. No varying thoughts take wing.<br>The equipoised in heart. A vision pure.</p><p>Verse 6-10. The Yogi seeks the wood's embracing shade. Alone he sits. his thoughts his only care.<br>From longing's ghost. from worldly wealth unweighed. On Self he muses. banishing despair.</p><p>Verse 6-11. Where solitude her quiet banner waves. A seat prepare. with reverent. hushed design.<br>Nor raised too high where reckless spirit raves. Nor sunk too low. where earthly shadows twine.<br>Of cloth. deer's hide. and Kusha's verdant grace.<br>A tranquil haven in that lonely space.</p><p>Verse 6-12. There. one-pointed mind. a steadfast flame. The senses hushed.<br>their restless yearnings cease. From fleeting joys. from worldly lure and blame.<br>He turns within. for self-purification's peace.</p><p>Verse 6-13. Body. head. and neck.<br>in perfect stillness bound. At nose's tip his gaze doth gently rest. No wandering glance on outward scenes is found.<br>Within his soul. by higher thoughts possessed.</p><p>Verse 6-14. Tranquil of soul. where fear's cold touch is lost. In celibacy's bond his strength is kept.<br>Mind's wild bird tamed. on Me his thoughts are crossed. United heart.<br>where sacred vows are swept.</p><p>Verse 6-15. Thus evermore the self he doth engage.<br>The Yogi's mind. by noble purpose led. He finds the peace of a celestial age.<br>In Nirvana's clime. where earthly woes are dead. Where in My being.<br>his true haven lies.</p><p>Verse 6-16. Too much of feasting dulls the spirit's eye.<br>And starves the soul of Yoga's mystic bread. Nor rigid fast beneath a cheerless sky. Where vital airs and strength of will are fled.<br>Sleep's leaden grasp. or waking's endless strain. Alike shall thwart the Yogin's holy gain.</p><p>Verse 6-17. But moderation. like a golden mean.<br>In food. in sport. in action's measured pace.<br>In slumber soft. and waking's gentle mien. Where balanced rhythms find their rightful place.<br>This Yoga brings a balm for every smart. And melts the sorrows of the yearning heart.</p><p>Verse 6-18. When mind subdued. in Self finds sweet repose. From every wish that earthly bosoms know.<br>Of worldly want. where discontentment grows. The Yogi stands.<br>where purest currents flow. Harmonized and free. a spirit bright.</p><p>Verse 6-19. As lamp that burns where no wild breezes stray. A simile for Yogi's tranquil might.<br>Whose mind controlled. doth cast a steady ray. To Yoga of the Self. a guiding light.</p><p>Verse 6-20. Where mind restrained by Yoga's potent art.<br>Finds stillness deep within its secret keep. Where Self by Self is known. a world apart.<br>And in the Self. content doth sweetly sleep.</p><p>Verse 6-21. That bliss supreme. by intellect embraced. Beyond the senses' fleeting.<br>fevered fire. Where. firmly fixed. no earthly storm can waste The soul's clear vision. or its high desire.</p><p>Verse 6-22. Which having found. no richer boon is craved. Than this dear treasure.<br>won with earnest pain. Here anchored fast. no grief can be engraved Upon the heart.<br>though sorrows rise like rain.</p><p>Verse 6-23. Know this as Yoga. severing all ties To sorrow's gloom. where heavy fetters cling. With steadfast will.<br>where true endeavor lies. With undaunted soul. let hope forever spring.</p><p>Verse 6-24. All cravings born of phantom. fleeting grace.<br>Discard them now. as dreams of night are flown. The senses' lure.<br>with mind's commanding space. Restrain them all. and claim them for thine own.</p><p>Verse 6-25. Slowly ascend. where gentle currents glide.<br>By intellect. thy truest guide and friend. The mind on Self shall peacefully abide.<br>No vagrant thought its sacred calm shall rend.</p><p>Verse 6-26. From whence the restless mind doth wildly veer.<br>Unstable as a leaf upon the breeze. From thence recall its wandering. wayward fear.<br>And to the Self. restore its wonted ease.</p><p>Verse 6-27. For Yogi's heart. where tranquil waters gleam. Whose passions sleep.<br>no earthly stain to find. Brahma-become. a pure and holy dream.<br>Attains to bliss. for spirit refined.</p><p>Verse 6-28. Thus evermore the self he doth engage. The Yogi. freed from sin's oppressive weight.<br>With gentle ease. the bliss of Brahman's age. He tastes.<br>a joy no words can articulate.</p><p>Verse 6-29. He sees the Self in every fragile form.<br>And every creature in Self's boundless sea. Equally seeing. through life's sun and storm.<br>The Yogi's soul. in sweet serenity.</p><p>Verse 6-30. Who sees Me ever with a loving eye. And all in Me. through darkness and through day.<br>He ne'er shall fade where shadows softly lie. Nor shall I vanish from his spirit's way.</p><p>Verse 6-31. Who. fixed in oneness. worships Me alone.<br>In every being that doth draw its breath. In whatsoever course his life is thrown. That Yogi dwells with Me. untouched by death.</p><p>Verse 6-32. Who views with equal gaze. O friend most dear. All beings' joy. all beings' silent tear.<br>As in his own deep heart. made crystal clear. That Yogi holds the highest station here.</p><p>Verse 6-33. Arjuna spake: O Madhusudana bright. This Yoga. of mind's steady. constant stay. Its firmest hold I cannot bring to sight.<br>So prone to restlessness is mortal clay.</p><p>Verse 6-34. For mind's a thing of fickle. fluttering flight. Tumultuous. strong.<br>defying gentle sway. To curb its course seems task beyond all might. As bridling winds that through the heavens play.</p><p>Verse 6-35. The Blessed Lord replied: 'Tis truth thou say'st. O mighty-armed.<br>the mind doth wander free. Yet practice firm. where steadfast will is placed.<br>And disenchantment's soothing remedy. Shall bind its flights. and bring its wildness tame.</p><p>Verse 6-36. For uncontrolled. Yoga's ascent is steep.<br>My wisdom this doth evermore declare. But self-controlled. whose watch doth never sleep.<br>By patient means. shall reach the realms so fair.</p><p>Verse 6-37. Arjuna spake: Who lacks the faith to soar. Though noble spirit feels no final blight. Yet mind astray.<br>from Yoga's longed-for shore Doth sadly drift into the shadowed night. What fate befalls. O Krishna.<br>gently tell. If perfection's crown he cannot win so well?</p><p>Verse 6-38. Like scattered cloud. across the void he's swept. From both realms lost.<br>no anchor can he find. Unrooted soul. where troubled thoughts are kept.<br>From Brahman's path. a spirit left behind.</p><p>Verse 6-39. This doubt of mine. O Krishna. grant release.<br>Let understanding shine with radiant art. For none but You can bring my spirit peace. And clarity bestow upon my heart.</p><p>Verse 6-40. The Blessed Lord declared: No darkening fate. O Partha.<br>waits in this terrestrial sphere. Nor in the realms beyond life's narrow gate. For one who strives with purpose true and clear.</p><p>Verse 6-41. The lands of pure and virtuous he gains. And dwells there long in bliss that knows no end.<br>Then falls from Yoga's high and sacred fanes. In homes of wealth and goodness to descend.</p><p>Verse 6-42. Or born within a Yogi's hallowed line. Where wisdom's lamp with steady radiance burns. Such birth.<br>indeed. a treasure most divine. For those whose persevering spirit yearns.</p><p>Verse 6-43. There he recalls that intellect's bright flame. Of former lives.<br>a memory held deep. And strives anew to reach perfection's name. His steadfast vows with fervent zeal to keep.</p><p>Verse 6-44. By that past practice. drawn with gentle might.<br>Irresistibly. to wisdom's beckoning call. Even the seeker.<br>guided by the light. Beyond mere ritual's shallow lessons fall.</p><p>Verse 6-45. But Yogi striving. with a spirit clean. Through countless births shall play his destined part.<br>Perfected thus. where no dark clouds convene. He reaches highest goal. with tranquil heart.</p><p>Verse 6-46. The Yogi greater than the austere sage.<br>Than those whose wisdom seeks a narrow bound. Than those whose deeds life's fleeting joys engage. Therefore.<br>O Arjuna. be a Yogi crowned.</p><p>Verse 6-47. And of all Yogis. him I hold most dear. Whose inmost soul on Me doth softly lean.<br>With faith profound. who worships without fear. Most perfectly in Yoga. his true mien</p>`

shore.</p><p>Fire, light, the daytime, and the bright fortnight,<br>The six months of the sun's northward flight,<br>Departing then, the men who know the Real,<br>To Brahman go, their final, high appeal.</p><p>Smoke, night-time, and the dark fortnight as well,<br>The six months of the sun's southward spell,<br>The yogi, reaching the lunar light's embrace,<br>Returns again, to this terrestrial place.</p><p>Light and darkness, these two paths are known,<br>To be the world's eternal, passing loan,<br>By one, he goes, to nevermore return,<br>By the other, he comes back, life's lessons to relearn.</p><p>Knowing these paths, O Partha, ever true,<br>The yogi is not bewildered, in all he has to do,<br>Therefore, at all times, be steadfast in your art,<br>O Arjuna, with yoga in your heart.</p><p>Whatever fruit of merit is declared,<br>In Vedas, sacrifices, and austerities shared,<br>In gifts of charity, with open hand,<br>The yogi, knowing this, will understand<br>And pass them all, to reach the high abode,<br>The first, supreme, and everlasting road.</p>`

to be told,<br>By knowing which, from evil you'll be free."</p><p>This royal knowledge, this deep mystery,<br>This purifier, supreme and ever bright,<br>Perceived directly, in virtue's glorious light,<br>Easy to practice, with a joyful soul,<br>Imperishable, making spirits whole.</p><p>Those who lack faith in this, my sacred law,<br>O harasser of foes, will ever draw<br>Back to the path of mortal birth and death,<br>Without attaining Me, with every breath.</p><p>By Me, in form unmanifest and grand,<br>This entire universe is ever spanned,<br>All beings have their roots in Me alone,<br>But I in them, am not so clearly shown.</p><p>And yet, the beings do not dwell in Me,<br>Behold My yoga, sovereign and so free,<br>My Self, the source of all, sustaining all,<br>Does not in them, let its own essence fall.</p><p>As the great wind, that moves in every place,<br>Rests ever in the ether's boundless space,<br>So know that all the beings, great and small,<br>Rest in My presence, answering to My call.</p><p>O son of Kunti, at the close of time,<br>All beings enter My own nature's clime,<br>And at the dawn of a new kalpa's day,<br>I send them forth, upon their fleeting way.</p><p>Animating My own nature, I again<br>And yet again, send forth this helpless train<br>Of beings, by the force of nature's might,<br>Into the world, of darkness and of light.</p><p>These actions, Partha, do not bind Me fast,<br>Sitting as one, indifferent to the last,<br>Unattached to all these deeds of mine,<br>My presence through creation will entwine.</p><p>Under My guidance, nature brings to birth,<br>The moving and unmoving, on this earth,<br>By this means, son of Kunti, you will find,<br>The world revolves, a pattern for the mind.</p><p>The foolish disregard Me, when I wear<br>A human form, a guise that I can bear,<br>My higher being, they do not perceive,<br>As the great Lord of all, they can't believe.</p><p>Of vain hopes, and of actions ever vain,<br>Of knowledge too, that brings but little gain,<br>They share the nature, senseless and so low,<br>Of fiends and giants, in delusion's glow.</p><p>But the great souls, O Partha, who partake<br>Of My divine nature, for My sake,<br>Worship with mind that never turns away,<br>Knowing Me as the source, from which all things did stray,<br>Imperishable, eternal, and so true,<br>Their loving hearts, forever I renew.</p><p>Always glorifying Me, with all their might,<br>Striving with firmness, in devotion's light,<br>Bowing to Me, with reverence and with grace,<br>They worship Me, in this terrestrial place,<br>Ever-steadfast, with a love so deep,<br>Their sacred vows, they evermore will keep.</p><p>Others again, with sacrifice's flame<br>Of knowledge, worship Me, and speak My name,<br>As one, as distinct, or in forms so grand,<br>Facing all ways, across this mortal land.</p><p>I am the rite, the sacrifice so pure,<br>The offering to the fathers, to endure,<br>The healing herb, the mantra's sacred sound,<br>The butter clarified, on holy ground,<br>I am the fire, the offering's sweet perfume,<br>Dispelling darkness, conquering all gloom.</p><p>I am the father of this world so vast,<br>The mother, the dispenser, whose decrees will last,<br>The grandsire too, the one who must be known,<br>The purifier, on His sacred throne,<br>The syllable "Om," the Rik, the Sama's grace,<br>The Yajur too, in this appointed place.</p><p>The goal, the sustainer, the Lord who reigns,<br>The witness, the abode, where peace remains,<br>The refuge, the friend, the origin's decree,<br>The dissolution, and the ground to be,<br>The treasury, the seed that will not fade,<br>In which all things, their final rest have made.</p><p>I give the heat, I hold back and send forth<br>The rain, that nourishes the thirsty earth,<br>I am immortality, and death as well,<br>Being and non-being, as the stories tell.</p><p>The knowers of the three, the Soma-drinkers pure,<br>Cleansed from their sins, their passage to secure,<br>Worshipping Me with sacrifice's art,<br>They pray for heaven, with a longing heart,<br>And reaching Indra's world, so holy and so bright,<br>They taste the pleasures of the gods, in pure delight.</p><p>Having enjoyed that spacious heaven's sphere,<br>Their merit spent, they enter again here,<br>This mortal world, where fleeting shadows creep,<br>Following the three Vedas, their desires they keep,<br>And going and returning, find no true release,<br>From worldly longings, that will never cease.</p><p>To those who worship Me, and think of Me alone,<br>With steadfast hearts, upon a royal throne<br>Of pure devotion, ever harmonized,<br>I bring full security, so highly prized.</p><p>Even those devotees of other gods, you see,<br>Who sacrifice with faith, they worship Me,<br>O son of Kunti, though not in the prescribed way,<br>Their hearts are true, in all they do and say.</p><p>For I of all the sacrifices, am the Lord,<br>The one enjoyer, by all heavens adored,<br>But they do not know Me in My essence true,<br>And so they fall, their earthly course to renew.</p><p>To gods, the worshippers of gods will go,<br>To fathers, those who love their fathers so,<br>To spirits, those who worship spirits' might,<br>And those who love Me, will attain My light.</p><p>Whoever offers Me with true devotion's art,<br>A leaf, a flower, a fruit, from a loving heart,<br>Or water pure, that offering of love,<br>I will accept, from a striving soul above.</p><p>Whatever you do, whatever you may eat,<br>Whatever you may offer, bitter or so sweet,<br>Whatever you may give, with open hand,<br>Whatever penance, in this mortal land,<br>Do it as an offering, to Me alone,<br>And find your peace, upon a royal throne.</p><p>Thus you'll be freed from the results that bind,<br>Both good and evil, in this world you'll find,<br>With mind steadfast in yoga's renunciation,<br>Liberated, you will reach My destination.</p><p>I am the same to all, in every place,<br>None is hateful, none is dear, in My embrace,<br>But those who worship Me with loving heart,<br>They are in Me, and I in them, a work of art.</p><p>Even if a sinner of the darkest dye,<br>Worships Me with a love that will not die,<br>He must be counted righteous, in his aim,<br>For he has rightly resolved, to speak My name.</p><p>Soon he becomes a soul of righteous might,<br>And attains to peace, that shines forever bright,<br>O son of Kunti, know this for a truth,<br>My devotee will never know life's ruth.</p><p>For those who take their refuge in My grace,<br>Though they be of lower birth, in this earthly race,<br>Women, Vaishyas, Shudras, ever true,<br>They too will reach the highest goal in view.</p><p>How much more then, the Brahmins, pure and bright,<br>The devotees, the royal saints of light,<br>Having attained this transient, joyless world,<br>Love and worship Me, with banners all unfurled.</p><p>Fix your mind on Me, be devoted in your art,<br>Sacrifice to Me, and bow with loving heart,<br>Having your self thus harmonized, you'll see,<br>You will attain, and come at last to Me.</p>`

            const aboutPageContent = `<h3>Our Mission</h3><p>Welcome to <strong>Śruti</strong>, a digital space dedicated to an immersive auditory experience of the Bhagavad Gita. The name itself, <em>Śruti</em>, refers to knowledge that is heard—a wisdom passed down through sound, resonating with us on a primal level. This project honors that tradition, presenting a poetic English rendition of the Gita designed to be listened to, reflected upon, and felt.</p><p>The Bhagavad Gita is the first scribed source of <em>Karmyoga</em> and a foundational <em>Smriti</em>—a collective memory embedded within us all. It is a universal conversation between the mortal (represented by Arjuna's questions) and the divine (represented by Krishna's wisdom). This dialogue transcends religion, race, and profession; it speaks to the core of the human condition.</p><p>Our goal is to offer this timeless wisdom in a clean, modern, and accessible format, free from the distractions of the modern web. This is a space for focus, learning, and introspection.</p><h3>A Note from the Author</h3><p>I created this rendition of the Gita out of a personal need—to understand this profound text in a way that felt authentic to me. The existing translations, while valuable, often felt dense and archaic. I wanted to hear the Gita's wisdom in a rhythm and voice that resonated with the way we communicate today. This project is the result of that journey.</p><p>This web application is designed to be a "clean internet" experience. It is free of cookies, trackers, and advertisements. It is simply a quiet room for you to listen, read, and explore.</p><h3>How to Use This App</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside"><li><strong>Playlist Navigation:</strong> On the left (or in the slide-out menu on mobile), you will find the chapter playlist. Click on any chapter to begin the audio and display the corresponding text.</li><li><strong>Read Along:</strong> As the audio plays, you can read the full poetic transcript in the main content area.</li><li><strong>AI-Powered Insights:</strong> At the bottom of each chapter's text, you'll find an input box. If a particular concept or verse sparks your curiosity, you can ask a question. Our integrated AI will provide a detailed explanation based on the context of the chapter you are listening to.</li><li><strong>Offline Experience (PWA):</strong> This app is a Progressive Web App (PWA). After your first visit, the audio and text for all chapters will be saved to your device, allowing you to listen and read offline. You can also "Add to Home Screen" on your mobile device for an app-like experience.</li></ul><h3>Listen on Your Favorite Platform</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside"><li><a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Link to Spotify Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Link to Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Link to Google Podcasts</a></li></ul><h3>Support This Project</h3><div class="text-center p-4 mt-4 border border-dashed border-stone-400 rounded-lg"><p><em>Your donation widget or link would go here.</em></p></div>`;
