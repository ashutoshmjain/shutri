- The first feels of using [[Logseq]] on [[Linux]] is lot better.
	- Feels much more responsive even on my old desktop. Certainly lot faster than the [[VSCode]].
- Thinking of using [[Logseq]] as the content manager for Shutri.com #Workflow
	- TODO Need to figure out how it will work with [[git]] and [[github]]
	- TODO Figure out how it will play with [[mdbook]]
	- The goal is to have some of the pages created by the Logseq  be published through [[mdbook]] to ghpages
	- TODO Review the folder structure and test out how the SUMMARY.md would look like.
	- TODO  open the graph on another device (Mac) from the git repo after syncing it with github.
- Wondering if I could bring [[Obsedian]] CSS to mdbook! Feels like a [[longshot]] .
