- Block chain technology is changing the way we compute, work and live. At the core of this change is something called a smart contract. We all know about smart contracts well enough but the question is all these contracts shall work to enable people with money.  I fail to understand how poor people are going to benefit for this scheme of transferring the value digitally.  And trust me I am not alone.  There is a huge number of leaders and general people who don't understand that our current financial system doesn't allow a much larger part of economy to be monetized because the cost of monetization of such low value transactions is just too much.  For example, you don't want want to pay for watching a creative video because paying say ten cents for a single view is just stupid. So the block chain guys came over and promised that they can handle these tiny transactions by the trillions a day - The biggest lie ever told on launch of a new technology. It was simply  a huge miss on what [[btc]]  set out to do and what it became, the reserve currency of the world. Where did it miss ?  Why no creative really has any cryptos, while billionaires are loading their butts on it.
