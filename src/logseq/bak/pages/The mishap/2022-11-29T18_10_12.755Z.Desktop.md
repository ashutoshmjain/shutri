- Seven months before  [[Parāśara]] 's birth  [[Bramh-rishi]] [[Vaśiṣṭha]]  — his grand father — woke up to a grotesque morning. His sprawling congregation ( `Ashrama` ), on the banks of river  `Yamuna` , sunk into deepest of grief. His son  [[Śakti Muni]]  — father of yet to be born  `Parāśara` , along with all the faculty and students, was killed by a tribal self-proclaimed king. Some religious accounts say  `Bramh-Rishi`  had one hundred sons taken that fateful morning. They probably mean  `Bramh-rishi`  treated all his followers, particularly the faculty members, like his own true-born.
- Only  `Bramh-rishi`  himself, and young wife of  `Śakti Muni`  —  `Adrushyanti` , survived the massacre.  `Adrushyanti`  was carrying yet to be born  `Parāśara`  — maybe two months into her pregnancy. The seat of knowledge, in India's foremost pilgrimage destination  `Mathura` , was in free blood-bath. In today's parlance, it would be as if someone killed everyone on Google campus. Hundreds of knowledge bearers left dead. Not even their wives were spared. Even children didn't get a plea for mercy.
- Saddened to the core, and unaware that the young widow was carrying,  `Vaśiṣṭha`  tried to commit suicide. He miraculously survived multiple attempts. Probably Gods wanted to extend his life to ensure unborn  `Parāśara`  got a chance at life. And more importantly, to save humanity from the loss of the 'knowledge' that was locked in  `Bramh-rishi's`  mind, **for there was no written text.**
