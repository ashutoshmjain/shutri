  Shutri means the spoken word. Or "what is heard". In a broader perspective of Hindu mythology, Shutri means all that we perceive. They say that the knowledge of music is prebuilt in the strings of Violin but the comprehensible music sounds only when the strings vibrate in a specific accord. In Sanskrit, `Shruti` that later got deformed into `Shutri` in Hindi, are the bundles of wisdom to invoke `Smriti` - the prebuilt knowledge. At the end of last session of Gita - `Arjuna` thanked `Krishna` . He said
  
  > Nashto Mohah Smritir Labdhah ;
  >
  > I am now free from delusions , Now I am with my internal knowledge `Smriti`.
  >
  
  In essence, `Smriti` is the incidence of knowledge in `Atma`. `Shruti` is a narrative, carefully crafted to invoke the `Smriti`.
