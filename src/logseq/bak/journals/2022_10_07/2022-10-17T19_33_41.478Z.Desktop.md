- [[Logseq]] is the best way to take notes under weed.
- [[Logseq]] cloud is a decentralized graph that pulls in a #hastag from all the connected participating local graphs. To build this I need to know [[clojure]] and also learn to build plugins for Logseq.
	- You will be able to access the cloud only if you share your own graph - something like leaching and seeding in the [[bitTorrent]] network.
	- Each graph will be identified with a @name. It will allow to see a specific graph or even to send a notification to the @name
