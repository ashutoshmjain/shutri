- The mechanism that bears the knowledge in a connected network of conscious beings, is known as  `Bramh` . Think of  `Bramh`  as a knowledge field of a social graph. Just the way mass must co-exists with [[electro-magnetic]] field, consciousness co-exists with a [[knowledgeField]] . In a way,  `Bramh`  holds the entire knowledge ,  [[Vishnu]]  turns this knowledge into manifestations. The way photons are perceivable particle state of EM fields, ‘actions —  `Karma` ’ are the manifested nature of knowledge field.
