- The first thing everyone should know is inflation in America is good for our allies. And it is good for America too.
- Lets first talk allies. Allies are the ones who supply us goods and services. And the ones we supply goods and services to.
	- When the price of toys rises in America, someone in China gets more money for their labor.
	- When price of a line of code rises in America , someone in India gets a raise.
	- The entire world economy is built around American consumer. If we pay more for coffee, some one in Latin America gets to put food on the table.
	- We said we will pay only 2% extra year over year but for heaven sake we are fighting deadliest epidemic to date. Why  can't we pay five , ten or even fifteen percent more for the goods we so luxuriously consume ? While the entire world serves us - The American consumer.
- Now let is talk about us
	- All of the Americans are inflation resistant because our assets appreciate at much faster pace than the consumables we get from China or India or the Latins.
	- The [[homeOwnerShip]] in [[America]] is about 65 %. Even if we say only 50 % of Americans are capitalized - means they have large amount of their savings in Assets such as stocks or real estate, then rest fifty % can be easily supported say through basic minimum income. If only we reorganize over two hundred state and federal support plans.
	- Which means Americans don't care about the price of bread or an Apple ! They do care for the Apple stock. As long as my portfolio is growing and the value of my home is up 8 % year over year , I dont care if I pay even fifty % more on thousand bucks I spend on the groceries ( the CPI bullbucket).
	- If inflation in oil price is ten% , we really don't care cuz oil is a tiny fraction of American household.
	- Sure lot of people need help but it is really not because there are less dollars , it it because the programs are not leveraging the technology. If they get better organized, every one can really depend on. Saying this cuz I am using affordable health care for last two years and it is better than any of the employers I had to this date - Simply because ACA is very well administered in California.
- The real question is what is Good for America
	- Asset inflation is good for for America because that is what creates the enigma.
	- American consumption and innovation engine is the best thing wold got to this date.
	- When this engine works, it lifts people out of poverty and it brings financial and social freedom all over the world.
	- American capitalism is the engine that drove the entire world for last three decades and see the pace of innovation ..
	- Many people think wall street bankers or the top managements or the VCs live glamorous life ! The truth is they all work so hard that they barely have time to enjoy their riches.  Elon Musk works 80 hours a week.  All their money is invested into fueling even more innovation.
	- And if you think wealth gap in America is too much , visit any developing country. There are people who literally don't get food - zero wealth. The wealth gap - is simply infinite. The only way to lift them out of poverty is technology and innovation. Smart phone penetration in India simply lifted millions out of poverty just through access to information and banking - this is not only government data, we can see it on the streets.
	- Stopping the wheel of innovation is literally a crime against humanity and it is obviously bad for what America stands for.
- We are just reaching the escape velocity. We are about to take off .. this is possibly the worst time to hit the breaks.
	- It is lot harder to get off the deflation than to withstand inflation because fed led deflation means even less earning - less jobs - lesser opportunities for small and big businesses alike.  The bigger problem is getting people out of scarcity mindset. It is almost impossible to ask people to risk their savings into setting up an enterprise if they have less.
	- There are two ways to set in deflation
		- Improve productivity through innovation - The good way
		- Reduce earning / opportunity that may lead to lower consumption - the bad way.
	- When fed jacks up the interest rates , it means demand for dollars goes up -->  higher price for the dollars. As the dollar price goes up, our allies get less . Their currencies fall vs dollar. Means they need to sell their dollar reserves . Look at Britain and Japan. Sterling can't hold against dollar. The fall of sterling means UK has to sell US treasuries.
	- In such a situation, if US demand goes down, it means their exporters start suffering,  Which basically means world hunger.
	- BTW higher consumption of US being a savior for the world is only applicable to US because US holds the reserve currency.  Any other nation can't print more of their currencies to spur their demand. Such a move say in India is counterproductive.
	- The falling exports to US means, US needs to pay even more interest to sustain the demand for dollars.  Which means more deflationary pressure. In a way, we are punishing  our suppliers to make dollar attractive to our foes.
	- Thus the only way to get out of hyper-inflation is hyper-productivity and to improve the supply chain.  And to accomplish both of them we need more innovation. Killing the innovation growth cycle is the biggest Fed Blunder.
	- To innovate more we need capital allocation handed over to corporations rather than national governments because businesses are lot better at improving the productivity than the Govs.
