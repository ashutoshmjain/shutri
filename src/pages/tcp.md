- The tccp/IP protocol is something that works on the premise of centralization. It's a protocol for [[clientServer]] applications. Means there is a central server on the network and then there are client applications.
- #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[gmail]] is a client server application,. There are thousands of servers in [[Google]]  data centers and every time you open a gmail app, it acts  as a client.
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- Does it mean it is bad ? No ..
- But we can do better with a totally decentralized protocol, such as [[bitTorrent]] or [[bitCoin]]
- Applications that  use these protocols are [[decentralized]] by design.
- And rooted deep under such applications is a protocol called [[gossip]]  - no kidding.
- The question is why is [[decetralized]] better ? And the answer is our [[realVerse]] is [[decetralized]]
- And that is the reason the [[metaVerse]] must be [[decentralized]] because in [[metaVerse]] , we are are trying to build something like our [[realVerse]]
- The question is how is our current computing landscape different from what we want to build.  ?
- The simplest answer is [[realVerse]] is active ,  the computer screen or TV for that matter , are passive. You sit and watch TV. [[metaVerse]] needs to be active like [[realVerse]]
- You walk through it. You learn by interacting with the stuff around. It must not be controlled by one corporation. It must have a [[creativeEconomy]]
