- The world is a collection of [[exchanges]]. Everything we do we pay with one of these --> this thus include all our living moments.
	- Our labor --> means our money.  Apple capitalizes your labor when you buy an iPhone with USD.  Industrial age was the force that drove this capitalistic trend.
	- Our Attention --> means eyeballs. Google capitalizes your attention when they sell you an ad. Information age is what drives this capitalistic trend.
	- Our Mind --> means what we care for. You will happily pay a charity to homeless people. We pay to watch HBO or sports. because we believe in the content. You might think it is a small fraction verses the first two. Think again , all the religions capitalized this to become most wealthy organizations.  Even nations capitalize our mind - sense of law , security, peace and freedom - all great things for which we happily pay half of our earnings as tax. This is a socialistic trend to bring balance of power with capitalism.
- But sure, [[corporations]] have shown great acumen in capitalizing labor as well as attention. [[Countries]] are still good but [[Religion]] has kinda faded into back ground - why ? Because they didn't adopt technology.
- So a new [[Religion]] is born - reincarnation. Just like last , the new has its own tanets
	- Decentralized Truth
	- Trust-less - no faith in humans. Believe in something bigger than you. The [[network]]
	- Reliance on superior mathematics (cryptography and computer science) just like a divine force.
	- Incarnation of a Godly person [[satoshi]]
	- And he showed a path and disappeared without any worldly greed.
- Crypto is thus not about monetizing your time or attention. It is to capitalize the mind of next generation. That is why it needs a [[generationalShift]]
- When that happens --> change occurs. Change creates new [[exchanges]] . Exchanges run the [[network]]
