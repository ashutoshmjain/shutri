- As far as the ‘why’ is concerned — there is a good answer. The congregation was rich. The legend says  [[Bramh-rishi]]  had a magical cow ( `Kaam Dhenu` ) that gave him everything he asked for — on demand ; but the obvious truth is, magical cow was the ‘Knowledge’. Knowledge attracts wealth — be it Apple, or be it Google of our times, or the  [[Ashrama]]s of the past, the source of wealth has always been the knowledge graph.  [[Vaśiṣṭha]]'s [[Ashrama]]  was by far the biggest research institute of that time. They were the keepers of inheritance from  [[Bramh]] . Many jealous eyes were set on the plush ‘wealth and peace’ of the congregation — material as well as intellectual.
