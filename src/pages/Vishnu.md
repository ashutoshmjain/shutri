- In  `Vaidik`  framework of Indian mythology, God is not a person. It is a combination of three basic protocols. The protocol that turns knowledge into manifested conscious beings when certain conditions are met, is known as  `Vishnu` . Each of the manifested being has a separate set of conditions required to manifest. In that, a mosquito is different from a snake. Hence,  `Vishnu`  is the collection of templates of creation. In his idol image,  `Vishnu`  is normally shown to bear the universal continuum  `Chakra`  on his finger. The incarnations of  `Vishnu`  lead the life to higher state of consciousness. For example first incarnation of  `Vishnu` ,  `Matsya Avtara`  a fish, symbolizes the conscious growth when living beings moved from water to solid earth. His second incarnation was  `Kurma`  a turtle depicting the ability of conscious beings to stay and live long on Earth. The ten incarnations of  `Vishnu`  are called  `Dashavataras`  . They are compared to evolution; Kurma - the amphibian - is regarded the next stage after Matysa, the fish. Here is the detailed [evolutionary interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara). It is important to mention that while all three have their respective representations in human form, only  `Vishnu`  may physically incarnate in human world. Obviously, because  `Vishnu`  is the science of manifestation. It must present reference examples.  [[Bramh]]  and  [[Siva]]  never incarnate in the physical world. #quantumJump
