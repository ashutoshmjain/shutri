  `Maha-Bharata` was the first major narrative written down in text. Even if it was a human endeavor, scribing such an immense scripture at that time, was no less than a divine grace. ` Krishna Dwiapayana`, the author of the epic,  made a crucial point in the very first book `Adi Parva` — narrating a scripture this complex to the masses, was almost impossible unless it was scribed in a book format . In a way, it was the tipping point, when humanity adopted a new medium for communication, and preserving the knowledge.

  This graph is a filtered version of my study and imagination investigating that revolution. And not surprisingly, it makes a fascinating story! And also a reflection on why humans keep changing the medium in pursuit to climb the ladder of consciousness! They also answer one question that stayed longer on my mind — why should I care? Why should any one care!. Turned out, our moral and physical dilemmas are not very different from that time.

  The gravity of his voice such that the words brought tears to  `Matsya's`  eyes — why can't I be like others O'  `Maharishi` ? Beautiful and fragrant? What worth this protected intelligence of, if I must live alone all my life?  `Maharishi`  heard the voice of truth, pain, and the deepest of desire, as she bowed and touched  `Maharishi Parasara's` feet. No argument could bring peace to  `Matsya`. She must live to be beautiful and fragrant, and she must enjoy all the pleasures thus far devoid off her.
