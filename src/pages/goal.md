- One of the thing that I realized in last few years  -  there is less acceptance for the long form text.  Some blame it on the new rich  media like [[social media platform]]s and some literally on the new generation. They say the new generation has less attention span.
- I always disagreed with above notion. I though, the shift to internet killed the books or long text cuz the books were simply dumped on the internet. Sure there is [[kindle]] to make the experience similar to reading a book but that isn't enough.
- Books need to adapt to the new channels - internet and metaverses.
- What  do I mean by adaptation ?

  Books  (particularly fiction) needs to be like a game. Users should have many routes to reach a level.  The fiction should hide in itself, the new levels of story. Users should crave to search those links through a maze. 
  
  Non fiction, should have a similar multi route strategy to unlock knowledge.

- That means a book should unfold in many possible direction from a single page. For example in this case - the home page `spotLight`
- To do this we need a writing style that's upside down with traditional form of writing. I call it [[mindGraph]]
- The good news is we now have [[graphDatabases]] that can do this. And thankfully we have [[Logseq]] to turn [[blocks]] of text into a graph.
- Want to know more about my [[graphJourney]] ?
