- # what is spotlight ? #graphWriting
- My home page to start writing something. It is the place to bring the search light to start exploring a #knowledgeStream . Many knowledge streams from many graphs might intersect with in spotLight.
- ## why ?
- One of the thing that I realized in last few years  -  there is less acceptance for the long form text.  Some blame it on the new rich  media and attention consuming design of the rich media platforms â€” and some literally on the new generation. They say the new generation has less attention span !  Then how come new generation is better than practically everything  - sports included.

- The shift to internet killed the books or long text cuz the books were simply dumped on the internet. Sure there is [[kindle]] to make the experience similar to reading a paper cover,  but that isn't enough.
- Books need to adapt to the new channels - internet and metaverses.
- ## What  do I mean by adaptation ?
- Books in the digital realm,  needs to be like a game. Users should have many routes to reach a level.  The fiction should hide in itself, the new levels of story. Users should crave to search those links through a maze. Non fiction, should have a similar multi route strategy to unlock knowledge.

  That means a book should unfold in many possible direction from a single small invocation on a page. For example in this case - the home page `spotLight` is a nest of many different types of narratives - a story graph , an epic graph , an idea graph , a knowledge graph

  To do this we need a writing style that's upside down with traditional form of writing. I call it [[mindGraph]]
- The good news is we now have [[graphDatabases]] that can do this. And thankfully we have [[Logseq]] to turn [[blocks]] of text into a graph.
