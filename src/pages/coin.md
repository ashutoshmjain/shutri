- In `Vaidik Times` , coins co-existed with barter system. Barter system was still widespread for the smaller transactions. Commoners used fruits and grains to get what they needed. Rich people used copper as a store of value. A one time adult meal was normally considered one copper coin. So was a ride fare. You could hop on and hop off any boat or cart at any place along its route for one copper coin. Super rich used copper for utensils at their home. For them the valuable was silver. 
  
  A silver coin was considered same as ten copper coins. One each for every single finger of two hands. Ultra rich ate their food in Silver utensils. For them store of value was a Gold coin. 
  
  A Gold coin was equal to ten Silver's. One for every finger of both the hands. The valuation was based on rough order of magnitude in mining these metals. Silver was considered ten times harder than copper, and Gold being an order of magnitude harder than Silver. 
  
  In a way [[proofOfWork]] was baked in universally acceptable currency. All states, no matter what their political equations, honored this simple "proof of work" based storage of value. Privacy , self custody and universality were the underpin of trading system. Nation states couldn't even imagine to start their own currencies ! Currency was pegged to people's trust in "proof of work". 
  
  Important point to note here, currency was not pegged to commodities such as iron. Gold, silver and copper were NOT commodities. Gold's only purpose was ornaments , silver was used purely for minting, and copper was primarily used for making utensils for the rich. Copper was supposedly the best metal to store food and water. Eating in silver, though common for rich, was considered a show-off. 
  
  This simple to understand and time tested system of power of ten, was later exploited by  [[Aryabhatta]] to conceptualize zero and decimal system - the very basis of modern arithmetic.
