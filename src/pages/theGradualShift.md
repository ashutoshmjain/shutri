- The idea that all the western countries would just give up their sovereign currencies and join [[bitCoin]] seems far fetched.
- What if every country has their own coin say  GUSD - where G stands for gov as a stable coin , backed by US Fed for one to one Dollar.
- China is already working on its central crypto-currency.   They call it CBDC  but is the notion of central currency is that it is a closed system. At some point they will anyway need to open it up cuz, currency alone is of no use till there are ton of financial services around it.  For example - people should be able to earn simple or compound interest.  They should be allowed to send it overseas.  People should be able to stake it or pay for the goods they wanna buy.
- If all the countries  - or say most of them; have their own digital coin , the question is what will be the global reserve currency ? My bet is on [[bitCoin]]
