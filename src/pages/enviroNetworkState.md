- Def: An environment oriented [[networkState]] is a [[hashgraph]]  or [[blockchains]] based distributed community that pledges consumption preference of its participant humans to registered businesses based on their willingness to pay an environmental tax. This tax is used to implement environment protection measures. A part of the tax revenue goes to human members to incentivize lesser consumption.
- We don't pay anything for the air, water and the earth. The three elements that we live in , under current economic system, are practically free. I mean the taxes that we pay are absolutely nothing. The environment oriented network states solve this problem. It is assumed there will be a million environment states running on common block chain with following concept. But the ultimate goal of this network is that most of the states come very close to similar parameters.
- Environment states offer their citizens a basic minimum income based on their air, water and land consumption.
- Businesses join the enviroStates because they get exclusive rights to sell to the citizens of network state.
- Both citizens and businesses can leave of join any state but they can be member of only one state at a time.

- What is the cost of environment. How to compute - Let us say for a country the cost of air is A, cost of water is W and cost of earth E . These are called parameters.
	- A = Total cubic feet of Air it holds X cost of air per citizen (a)
	- W = Total cubic feet of water it holds X cost of water per citizen (w)
	- E = Total square mile of land it holds X cost of land per citizen
- Citizen cost to be borne by countries by  taxing the corporations, businesses, non profits and government operative agencies. Total tax to be collected by each country is  thus = A + W + E
	- They collect this tax by proportionating the the total amount based on the amount of earth , water and air they consume.
	- Any business that doesn't report their consumption is charged the [[maxLevel]]
	- Reporting  your land and water consumption is easy and straight forward.
		- Air consumption is based on the people they deploy - air consumed per person is easy to compute. Business pays for the number of hours they used of people.
		- Air consumed by machines is also easy compute  with air meters installed on every machine.
		- An extra surcharge may be applied for polluting machines.
- The model means swith either less population or less natural resources need to collect less tax. A natural incentive for businesses to move there.
- Humans are free to move anywhere they choose to. No government may say a no to any citizen.
- This will make citizen to move to the places where businesses are because they offer better job opportunities as well lesser cost of goods.
- Which will in turn make the tax burden of the country more.
- Ultimately an equilibrium will set in. Arbitraray values of a, w and e will become stable.
- This process brings equitable utilization of resources - #firstStep
- The next question is how incentivize less consumption.
- A % of tax revenue is distributed by governments as a basic minimum income. Rest is spent replenishing the environment.
	- Basic minimum income is inversely proportion to a citizen's consumption of air, water and land.
	- Top consumer obviously gets zero , progressing gradually to max for the least consumer.
- Lesser consumption brings down the per capita average,  and also demand for businesses.
- Hypothetically a state with zero consumption needs no revenue. Such states are called #enviroStates because they spend all their revenue on environment protection.
- Businesses are thus motivated to produce things that make more economic sense to produce, means they could save after paying the capital expenses, wages and tax.
- Citizens have a choice, to move to any state they feel is good for them.
- Only thing that citizens pledge, is to buy only from those corporations that are listed with the state.
- Partial citizenship may be explored in next version of the smart contract.
