- 90 % of my buying decisions are based on the customer reviews.
- Be it Amazon or AirBnB, once I like a product, I make sure to read the reviews before I check the cart out.
- On youtube I am even more prudent. I first read few comments before committing my fifteen minutes to the video (and five minutes of [[shamelessPromotions]])
- My bet is most of the [[investors]] do the same.
- When so much is riding on the "reviews" , the question is what are we doing to improve the review process ?
- You may want to ask what is wrong with current process ? so much that we need to change it ? Here are few thoughts
	- The reviews are locked into thousands of databases that don't talk to each other. For example all your reviews on the same product on Amazon, are not available to similar product at walmart - why ?
	- Because Amazon and Walmart want to have complete control of their product's online reputation. And they should be.
	- But as an [[investor]] , don't you have any right on your reviews ?
	- Well your right is sure not money, because money is for the product. Money is the store of value. Your review was just a little metadata when you transferred the value to the seller. You may ask for a discount in the product value if your seller is interested in your review. They may even ship you the product free, as they do with many influencers. All that is fine , but the moment you accept money for your review, then the review itself becomes a product. It matures from meta data to product itself. You will probably become a brand promoter from an investor.
	- Thus your right is not money.
	- But it doesn't mean you have no right ! what is it ? #investorRights
- Your right is to know exact feedback of other [[investors]].
- That is why the reviews of other investors, need to be beyond control of likes of Amazon, Walmart or Youtube.
	- No one should be able to temper or alter your reviews - means they should be [[immutable]]
	- You should be able to protect your identity from your reviews. Because you as a tiny investor don't need any unnecessary dispute with the big boys. If this protection is not there, no one will write real review.
	- It must not attach any cost to your buy transaction.
	- Only those should be able to access your reviews who in return provide you the same favor.
	- You should be able to attach multiple online products with your reviews - say a url to amazon and another to the same product on walmart.
	- You should have right to sorting any online assortment (online market places) based on availability of real reviews. It should not be left to the choice of corporation running the online store.
	- You should not be asked to attach your id separately on every shopping site. Because this information belongs to you - not to the online shopping store - unless they provide you a discount.
- At the same time, realReviews must provide simple and intuitive APIs to allow any online shopping store to integrate realReviews without major technical challenge.
- Such a business process is called [[complimentaryBusinessProcesses]]
