- First focus on two icons. One on the top left and another on the top right, of your screen. Both these open a pane on your screen. Need I say,  that the left one does on the left side of the screen and right one --- you got it.  So this website has three panes.
- The left side is a "canned" pane that helps you interact with the graph. I don't change much there cuz I don't know how to do that.
- The right side is more interesting. If you click on the icon on the extreme right top of your screen, you will see a vertical pane with  menu items such as "content", "Page graph" and help. They too are canned ðŸ˜ƒ   ....  But there is a cool thing in the left side pane - it is a [[verticalStack]] .

  Understanding vertical stack is probably the most important part of this game . Trust me, I can't stress more !

- If you feel lost in this jungle, you can always press the "home" icon  to get back to spot light page or simply press  `g h` - as in "go home" on your keyboard.
- Every hyperlink  has a [[sneakPeak]] view.
- You can come retract back one link at a time or move forward your navigation history by clicking on the arrows.  An easier way is to use keyboard shortcut - `Cmd [` for back and `Cmd ]`  for forward.
- You can get to all the shortcuts by clicking on the question mark  `?`  the bottom right of this screen.

  The fun starts when you master the keyboard shortcuts. ,, Trust me .  But since you are checking this on an age old Browser on your age old computer. , some of the short cuts may not work the way they work in the app.
