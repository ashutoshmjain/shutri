- What is [[spotLight]]
	- Spot light is this middle pane.  The one you get when you browse to [[shutri.com]]. This is the #entryStream to my graph. Graphs are anyway confusing. A [[mindGraph]] is even more. This is my way to let the reader ease into my mind graph.

	  You might get lost in this maze.  Please be considerate of your time. 
	  Don't panic to structure these pages in your mind. This is my structure - not yours. Save yourself from [[chaos]]
	  They say [[compassion]] is the best fitness strategy ðŸ™ƒ

	- I try to publish my spotLight every day. But some days are meh ..
	- The new publications may be a blog graph , or a poetry graph or even a story. They show up as **"Linked References"** below. Feel free to click on them but I highly recommend to run through [[navigation]] first ..
	- In other words â€” if I tag a page to spotLight (this page) , then that page shows us as a linked page below. I tag a page to spotLight only when I feel it is worth your attention.  I kinda spent some effort to curate it for public consumption. There are other pages that I am still working on. Hopefully , they will make to spotLight someday! It is a slow process :-) because I have no commercial interest or corporate pressure to deliver something. It is just fun and you should also take it in the same spirit. There is no warranty of accuracy here. No expectation of support whatsoever. It is all creative commons to say the least.

	  You can always get back here on `spotLight` by clicking the `HOME` button on the top ..

- I treat this page as if I am talking to a stranger in a virtual world. A little peak into my mind. When I say learn or collaborate, the idea is to understand how to use and share a [[mindGraph]]
