- Chaos is our efforts to structure the reality as per our [[mindGraph]]. Chaos is a prerequisite of [[order]] and vice versa.  Our [[sensoryReality]] is chaotic till we make peace with it through [[compassion]]
- Connections are hard to make (particularly in [[metaVerse]] ) because the moment we have access to entire [[mindGraph]] , we attempt to curate it the way our mind thinks. We want to create an [[order]] in [[chaos]].
- We perceive [[order]] when physical reality is structured as per our [[mindGraph]].  Other wise we perceive [[chaos]]

  Don't panic to structure these pages in your mind. This is my structure - not yours. Save yourself from [[chaos]]
