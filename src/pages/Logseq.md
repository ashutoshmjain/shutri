- Logseq is a  personal knowledge management tool. It is simply the upside down view of what we have been doing to-date. In the bygone world, writer was expected to create a folder structure , a hierarchy of thoughts. The problem was many ideas belonged to many articles in different folders. Not only this, remembering the folder structure was a pain in itself. If you went on a vacation, by the time you came back , you forgot where the hell are buried your most precious words. 
  
  Google came up with search. They thought that you will probably search your own work the way you do the internet. It just didn't work. Because you don't even remember that you had approached the same topic in a totally different context.
