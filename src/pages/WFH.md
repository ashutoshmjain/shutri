- My brother used to work for a public sector corporation in India. He never even considered possible that I work from home - a sales job.
  
  Till the [[covidLockDowns]] struck.
  
  And then I wondered,  and joked around, how his driver was bringing (paper) files from office and he signed on them - of course after reading and sanitizing them :-)
  
  This is the extent of change , the pandemic brought - The idea of Work from Home is no more an [[americanFad]] .
