  If it took us say five thousand years from the wheel to a car, it had probably taken fifty thousand, to evolve the ‚Äòwheels‚Äô, for knowledge is never a straight line. It is a curve that curls up exponentially with time.  When it reaches an almost vertical trajectory,  a lot happens in a very little time. For example creation of universe ‚Äî the inflationary epoch, is one such thing.  I call this quantum Jump. Why quantum?  Because it is a shift from one state to another. Btw it is not a physical jump ‚Äî  it's not a long jump üòÅ -  Not even a high jump. It's a jump in Time!
