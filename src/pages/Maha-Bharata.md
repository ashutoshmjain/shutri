- Not only did Krishna [[Dwaipayana]]  edit the four [[Vedas]] , he also scribed eighteen  `Puranas`  and wrote the master piece  `Jaya`  (victory) — the story of Lord Sri  [[Krsna]]  and  [[Arjuna]] . It was later expanded into a mega-epic,  `Maha-Bharata` , his familial memoir - spanning his own and next two generations.  `Maha-Bharata` , with around 1.8 million words, is the longest written poetic collection ever, in any language, old or new. To put it in perspective, it is about ten times the size of Iliad and Odyssey combined. 
  
  More than the size, the quality of poetry is such that it inspired  [[Kalidasa]]  . In fact,  `Shakuntalam`  is a rewrite of the plot first conceived by  [[Dwaipayana]]  in  `Maha-Bharata` . In addition to poetic excellence,  `Maha-Bharata`  defined a new way of life — action orientation [[Karm-Yoga]]. The epic forms the cultural basis of one of the oldest civilization. It holds within it, center-folded, the gist of four Vedas —  [[Bagvad-Gita]]  — the first written source of the idea of  [[Karma]]  without desires.

  The question is, how did  `Krishna`   [[Dwaipayana]] manage to write such epics at a time when scribing , in itself, was a major challenge? — there was no spell check, no grammar support! In fact, Sanskrit Grammar was not even formalized yet. And of-course there was no computer. Not even a type-writer!

- ## Scribing Maha-Bharata
	- The legend says, Krishna invoked  `Bramha` ( [[Bramh]]  in human form) to seek help in scribing  `Maha-Bharata` .  `Bramha` , in his infinite wisdom, advised him to seek help from son of  [[Siva]] — [[Ganesa]] : who possessed the superior intelligence to scribe such a vast body of work.
	  
	  `Adi Parva`  the first book of  `Mahabharata`  describes this story in all it's poetical glory. Translated by  [[Kisari Mohan Ganguly]]  , here is an excerpt -
		- #+BEGIN_VERSE
		  The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of Parasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider how he might teach it to his disciples.
		  
		  And the possessor of the six attributes, Brahma, the world's preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for gratifying the saint, and benefiting the people.
		  
		  And when Vyasa, surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised; and, standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought.
		  
		  And Vyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on that distinguished seat, stood near it;
		  
		  and being commanded by Brahma Parameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in joy.
		  
		  Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi, said,
		  
		  "O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me;
		  
		  the various rituals of the Upanishadas with the Angas;
		  
		  the compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the three divisions of time, past, present, and future;
		  
		  the determination of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a description of creeds and of the various modes of life;
		  
		  rule for the four castes, and the import of all the Puranas;
		  
		  an account of asceticism and of the duties of a religious student;
		  
		  the dimensions of the sun and moon, the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four ages;
		  
		  the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas;
		  
		  also the Adhyatma;
		  
		  the sciences called Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases;
		  
		  charity and Pasupatadharma;
		  
		  birth celestial and human, for particular purposes;
		  
		  also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers,
		  
		  mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas;
		  
		  the art of war;
		  
		  the different kinds of nations and languages:
		  
		  the nature of the manners of the people;
		  
		  and the all-pervading spirit;
		  
		  all these have been represented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on earth.'
		  
		  "Brahma said.
		  
		  'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity of their lives.
		  
		  I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first utterance, in the language of truth.
		  
		  Thou hast called thy present work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem.
		  
		  There shall be no poets whose works may equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other modes called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama.
		  
		  Let [[Ganesa]] be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.'

	- `Ganesa`  — the embodiment of ‘intelligence’ told he would stop writing if  `Krishna`  paused even for a moment, for there was no time to waste.  `Krishna`  agreed, but he (tactfully) added,  [[Ganesa]]  must scribe a verse only after fully understanding the intent, because text was meant for a human mind.
		- #+BEGIN_VERSE
		  "Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered,
		  
		  'I will become the writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing."
		  
		  And Vyasa said unto that divinity,
		  
		  'Wherever there be anything thou dost not comprehend, cease to continue writing.'
		  
		  Ganesa having signified his assent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write;
		  
		  and Vyasa began;
		  
		  and by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close;
		  
		  by doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.

- `Mahabharta`  was scribed in eighteen  `Parvas`  (books). The first book -  `Adi Parva`  , an abridged version that tells the story of the story, appears to be a later addition for it describes above incident — the divine intervention to scribe the entire epic. The key point is  `Mahabharata`  is not only the longest poem, it was the first major narrative written down in text. Even if it was a human endeavor, scribing such an immense scripture at that time, was no less than a divine grace. And  `Vyasa`  made a crucial point — narrating a scripture this complex to the masses, was almost impossible unless it was scribed into [[text]] . In a way, it was the tipping point, when humanity added a new medium for communication, and preserving the knowledge.
- Maha-Bharata has eighteen books. Each of them with hundreds of chapters. The book as well as chapters are called `Parva`. 
  
  Here are few sample sections ..
