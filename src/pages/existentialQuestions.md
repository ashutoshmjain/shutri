	- How far are we from the quantum jump ?
		- Not far. In fact it is Now. In this very moment.
	- Who will make it to the other side ?

	- How do I make sure I am part of the ride ?
		- This is a tricky question ! Because it is different for everyone. I can only share [[myExperience]].  You will need to figure out your own.
