- When we read a narrative or watch a video, only some of the points rhyme with our mind. If there are many, we click the like button. Our [[quest]] is to fructify our own ideas. We borrow [[blocks]] or sub-ideas from others. Thus blocks are a great way to make connection.
- In other words, when a similar block exists in two [[mindGraph]]s , a connection is formed. When there are very many connections , a relationship is formed.
- Effectively mindGraphs may be joined to form a [[graphCloud]].
