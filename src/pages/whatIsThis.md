	- This is my [[Logseq]] graph published to the web.
	- There are many ways to publish logseq to the web. Some of them use [[github]] actions and others try to publish the content in "hugo" format.  I am doing it manually, without any gh actions or tools.  Here are my simple step ..
- But wait - Before I bog your mind down with technology, let  us just focus on this page.  How does this website work.
	- First focus on two icons. One on the top left and another on the top right, of your screen. Both these open a pane on your screen. Need I say that the left one does on the left side of the screen and right one --- you got it.  So this website has three panes.
	- The left side is a "canned" pane that helps you interact with the graph. I don't change much there cuz I don't know how to do that.
	- The right side is more interesting. If you click on the icon on the extreme right top of your screen, you will see a vertical pane with  menu items such as "content", "Page graph" and help. They too are canned !
	- But there is a cool thing in the left side pane - it is a vertical stack. Let me explain what is vertical stack.  ..
	- If you see and #hashtag or a [[double bracket]] anywhere in this text , think of it as a "page". If you click on the page, that page will open in this very pane. But if you press "Shift" button on your keyboard and then click on the hastag or a double bracket, the page will open in the right hand side pane.

	  Then what is this vertical stack ?  It means if you Shift Click a page (hashtag or a double bracket) , it will persist in the right hand side pane. 
	  
	  hmm - what do you mean by persist - It simply means, the page will stay there . If you shift click another hashtag , the previous page shall move down and the new page will open on the top. 
	  
	  You can have as many pages open in the right hand pane as you want. They will stay there till you "X" them out.
