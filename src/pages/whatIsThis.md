	- This is my [[Logseq]] graph published to the web.
	- There are many ways to publish logseq to the web. Some of them use [[github]] actions and others try to publish the content in "hugo" format.  I am doing it manually, without any gh actions or tools.  Here are my [[simpleSteps]] ..
- But wait - Before I bog your mind down with technology, let  us just focus on this page please.  How does the **navigation** work ?
	- First focus on two icons. One on the top left and another on the top right, of your screen. Both these open a pane on your screen. Need I say,  that the left one does on the left side of the screen and right one --- you got it.  So this website has three panes.
	- The left side is a "canned" pane that helps you interact with the graph. I don't change much there cuz I don't know how to do that.
	- The right side is more interesting. If you click on the icon on the extreme right top of your screen, you will see a vertical pane with  menu items such as "content", "Page graph" and help. They too are canned ðŸ˜ƒ   ....  But there is a cool thing in the left side pane - it is a vertical stack. Let me explain what is a [[verticalStack]]   ..
	- If you feel lost in this jungle, you can always press the "home" icon  to get back here. or simply press  "g h" - as in go home on your keyboard.
- Every hyperlink (hashtag or a double bracket) has a "sneak peak" view.  Just hover your mouse over the link and it will open a window right on the link to view the contents.  Unlike other tools, logseq sneak view is very persistent. You can read really long text in the sneak view and even click on the links with in.  It helps to solve the mess of links.
- You can come retract back one link at a time or move forward your navigation history by clicking on the arrows.  An easier way is to use keyboard shortcut - Cmd [ for back and Cmd ]  for forward.
- You can get to all the shortcuts by clicking on the question mark at the bottom right of this screen.

  The fun starts when you master the keyboard shortcuts. ,, Trust me .  But since you are checking this on an age old Browser on your age old computer. , some of the short cuts may not work the way they work in the app.
