- A journal is where you actively log the things that you have done  or are planning to do.
  
  Your search history is reverse journal, because from your search you can see date wise and hour wise as to what you actually did.
  
  In [[Logseq]] it is kinda hard to keep a track of what all things you did. It think it will be a good idea to provide your activity list.
