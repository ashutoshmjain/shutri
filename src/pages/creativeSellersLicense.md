- Creative commons is a great license but it has some limitations. First, most of the work on CC comes from them who don't care for money. They either don't need to care for their bills or they don't have many bills - means they ate `Yogies`. But unfortunately most of the world is not. Second, since the body of work from such people is limited, viewers go to the content sources that don't care about the licenses at all. How many copy right infringements are there on Youtube! We can't even fathom to count. The solution is obviously not in asking people to just forget about the value of their creative work. If someone wants to share their work under free and creative labels, great but what about those who genuinely want to price their work !
