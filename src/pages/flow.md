- As a writer and a reader, I see  two distinct flows with text - The readers' flow and the writer's flow.  The reader's flow is probably even more important than the grammar or even the "quality of Language".
	- Let's talk about the writers' first .  When I write in a normal text editor, I tend to explain the context or concept  I am talking about in great deal, because I feel that is a window to convey to the reader. If I missed this window, it  feels like a lost opportunity to say a thing.  The cost of creating a foot note or even a hyperlinked page is just too much for a writer assuming she needs to create thousands of link for tiny pages explaining just one little thing. And it is equally nerve recking for the reader to open all those link in the  separate tabs of a browser.
	- With this graph tool. I can simply #hashtag the topic telling myself that I have a pre-existing page that I can come back to populate. This makes me stay to the point without getting into gory details. I can even `shift + click` on the link I just created  to open it in the side pane and write my little nugget of knowledge there.
	- How does it translate for the reader?  Instead of running down to the foot notes or clicking on the page links, reader can have a pretty nice sneak peak right there in the main window without losing the place she was reading at. If she needs something more persistent, she can `Shift + Click` to move the link in the vertical stack on the right hand side. When she does the next `Shift + click` , the current top link moves a window down.  There can be hundreds of open pages in vertical stack.
	- This means reader doesn't need to worry about organizing the tabs or keeping a track of history.

	  And here is the best part. 
	  All your open windows persist even when you refresh the browser or close it .
	  Next time when you launch Chrome of Safari ; your open links persist in the side pane.
