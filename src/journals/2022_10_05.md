- You need to look good when you are representing someone. You can be yourself when you are representing you. #myQuotes
- It is no secret that the best neural networks are the ones in our mind. We have 300x parameters in single human brain than the toys that [[Google]] is making - they call it [[deepMind]] but 'Deep Mind' is way less deeper than a single human mind. The obvious thing that even [[Elon]] missed is that it is the intelligence in human brains that is making all the things - be it self driving cars or the space faring rockets. While they are spending billions of dollars in making the AI based robots, there are seven billions simply roaming around on the face of earth. And this is assuming only humans have good quality harnessable nueral networks though the fact is even animals have much better neural engines that the best made on silicon todate. #mindLang
  
  The silicone based networks just fail to provide so many connections so efficiently because, these connections 'grow' based on the environment. The environment is NOT just a training model, it is where survival instincts build the neurons and connect them to solve the problems. I mean that is what corporations harness all the time. They recruit people and put them in specific situations. Those who survive the difficult situations, build the solutions. Even combat forces do the same. Generals send the soldiers into harmsways. There, soldiers develop the general intelligence networks in their brains - first to survive and than to conquer.
  
  Office was another such environment. People come together in one location to solve connected problems. And they developed networks that went beyond a singular mind. They say one plus one is not two - it is eleven. Why? - because when you add neural networks, the problem solving capacity is not twice, it is an order or magnitude more. 
  
  Now that we are working at homes (or not working at all), how do we connect the minds. The human minds observe problem space from the environment they are in. They create solutions for the problems they face. [[mindLang]] is a model , a solution or a framework to connect human brains efficiently on a common problem without them having to physically co-locate. Because now we can bring the best of the talents together in [[mindLand]] - a metaverse runtime environment for [[mindLang]]
- It became a common knowledge that humans and (every other species) are self preserving AI units - because we use (difficult) environment for designing our neural engine and then we use the same engine to conquer the problem space. Not only that, we destroy ourselves when the problem is conquered because the cost of rewiring the brains is lot more than creating a fresh human brain. In absence of this self evolving, self sustaining and self destroying aspect - artificial intelligence is just a toy. And the survival was not on how many neurons we may build. It was on the efficiency. Each organism is made for exact existing situation and it presishes when the problem is resolved. Artificial AIs can not sustain a day out in the wild. They may do great things in the lab and environments supported by humans and helped humans augment but they fail miserably when sent alone to far flung planets in search of unknown. On the other hand tiny bacteria survive even in the harshest places say Mars. #mindLang
