- What does it mean to have [[spirituality in technology]]? Is there a better word.
- Most subtle tech inventions. Are they what I mean from [[spirituality in technology]].
	- [[Mark down]] - The idea that html can be written easily by humans.
	- Vi style key mapping - The idea that you can use keyboard to move around in your text. You don't really need any other device. #vim
	- [[git]]  - the knowledge is in the commits. In the version history.
	- [[nix]] package manager  - The idea that a folder may have a unique hash for the content it carries. Also means no one should be able to change the contents of the folder. What good is such a folder than? Turns out this is what we need to store the applications delivered to the computer. Which also means every time you make a change to the application, it is a new version - it must be stored separately in a new folder.
	- iPod - People love music. Steve saw this when he saw the rise of Napster. He anyway, himself loved the music.  That meant everyone should be able to carry all their music with them. Device needed an application to upload music from PC. That led to iTunes. When this got popular, Steve started selling legit songs that could be purchased from Apple. Business grows like a Tress.

- Writing is the reflection of our brains. Before we start writing things for the public consumption , we need to harvest our thoughts . That is where [[Logseq]] fits in. It is a way to organize your research, todos, fleeting thoughts into a graph that you can use anytime you want to expand on a certain topic. May be years later.
- Don't think [[Logseq]] of brain harvesting is something that you should start when or if at all you wanna become a writer. In fact the chances of your becoming a good writer are dependent on how good you are at harvesting your own brain.
- [[Logseq]] converts the art of writing from a [[desire]] to a [[Karma]].
- If you are not happy yourself why would people want to emulate you?  If you are not happy, you will want to emulate others. Everyone wants to be happier.
	- One way of saying this is "Try to feel Happy" - that is what we call Spirituality, or Bhakti or even Love.
	- The other way is to go grab that happiness - what we call materialism, consumption based society.
	- Both of them are asking you to sacrifice your time for something tangible. They are promising something in the future.  They are asking you to live a dingy life for something supernaturally great in the future.
	- They are selling you happiness - A thing that you already have.
	- Question is how do we find that thing ? Why?
	- Because that thing is always happy , that thing is your quest.  That is what we call `Atma`
	- `Karm Yoga ` is way to start living that thing. That click is an event. A switch. When you become one with your `Karma`. Means you are attached to your actions. You find pleasure in working.
- Graph is taking over the writing.
- [[creativeSellersLicense]] #blocks-chain
	- Creative commons is a great license but it has some limitations. First, most of the work on CC comes from them who don't care for money. They either don't need to care for their bills or they don't have many bills - means they ate `Yogies`. But unfortunately most of the world is not. Second, since the body of work from such people is limited, viewers go to the content sources that don't care about the licenses at all. How many copy right infringements are there on Youtube! We can't even fathom to count. The solution is obviously not in asking people to just forget about the value of their creative work. If someone wants to share their work under free and creative labels, great but what about those who genuinely want to price their work !

	- Other reason is there is no other way for the creatives. Even if I want to sell a block of my work - a piece of text or a poem or a digital art  - What is the way.  Enter the NFTs but NFTs are kinda kinky.
	  id:: 633ce0ee-2f8e-4a6d-8a86-a8ba57257043
	- A great misconception is the buyers of your digital work are your readers. That may be true for great writers or poets  or artists. But most of the work that you produce is used by people who want to use your work for a bigger piece of art. For example someone might want to convert your poem into a song. Someone might want to convert your story into a marvel short.
	- So in this context , your readers are basically your co-creators , just like editors , professional reviewers and publishers etc. The readers make your work to bubble to the top by adding likes and comments. More reaction you get from your readers , more is your work likely to be picked up by your customers.
	- So you need to give a part of your revenue to your readers. Because they are spending time in reading , sharing and championing your work. Where is such a platform ?
	- We need to start with a simple  Creative sellers licence.
