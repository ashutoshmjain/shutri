Crypto currencies have a love hate syndrome with humans. Some of them are are simply in love with the idea. Others simply hate them. One thing is pretty sure no one really understands the implications. Don't get me wrong, there are many who understand the technology but what I mean from ‘implications’ is the long term effect on geo political situation for control over the currency is the real power. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum are great piece of technology. And probably even greater application of these technologies are beyond currencies , say NFTs or the domain name services that are kinda dubbed as web 3.0 these days. 

However, in my mind, the most far reaching application of these technologies are stable coins. We will see down the line, why stable coins are the biggest impact on our current society and what exactly they mean for the world beyond US borders. And also, why there is literally only one underlying currency for stable coins - USD.

During the course of this article, I will also add as to why governments across the globe (including US) are so not sure what to do with stable coins.
