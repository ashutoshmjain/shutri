Before the ‘written word’ became the mainstream mechanism to preserve literature, scriptures were passed on as `Shruti` — the spoken word. A choir of reciters chanted the hymns (`Richas and Mantras`) whole day long — from the early morning to the late evening. Certain `mantras` must be recited at a specific time of the day, and at a specific place. Some of them must be performed in front of the holy fire — rites. Composers, a level-above the reciters, helped them get the pronunciation right and attune a `Vaidik` elocution style. And finally the editors `Vyasas` were responsible for the content. `Vyasas` were there to make sure the spoken content was current, accurate and in exact line with the messages of sages and super sages. Their stated objective was to keep the knowledge current and distributed over as many human minds as feasible — a trustless block chain of knowledge distributed over biological nodes. `Vyasas` ran carefully designed distribution and consensus protocols.

  A typical path for an aspiring student (`Vidyarathi`) seeking a degree in the authentic scriptures (`Shaastras`) was to join a congregation (`Ashrama`), on a full-time live-in basis. Life in an `Ashrama` was not easy. A student was expected to follow a tight celibate routine, full of chores and service before s/he got to the lessons. S/he must prove s/he was worthy of the knowledge. Then only s/he would make it to the choir. Chores and menial tasks were considered mandatory to mellow down (or even eradicate) exaggerated notion of ˝self˝ and be one with the ˝word˝. The wealth of congregation didn't make it easier for the students. `Parāśara` didn't get a free pass when it came to the rigor. Quite the opposite —  he had to double up.

A degree holder was called a `Snataka`. A `Snataka` needed to go through rigorous years of apprenticeship with a teacher `Aacharya` to become certified in administering ‘rites’, when s/he was called a `Shastri` — someone who knew scriptures. At that stage, s/he could leave to spread the rites in cities and villages far, or become an `Aacharya` — the teacher — based on her inclination and the rigor s/he wanted to put in. Only few `Aacharya` with demonstrable authority on all the known scriptures would get to the coveted title of `Vyasa`. In nutshell, there was a whole organization to moderate, curate and to disseminate the audio content — to make sure the knowledge was passed-on (without distortion), to seekers in current generation, and the next.

There was another path available to students if recital wasn't their strong suite — research — seeking knowledge (`Nyana`). This path demanded lot more patience and sacrifice!  If someone was keen to take on research, after graduating as a `Snataka`, s/he would choose a major in a specific field. The hard work on this path was called `Sadhna` meaning extreme focus on a specific goal (`Sadhya`). One who accomplished her goal was called `Sidhah`. 

Such a path led to titles such as `Rishi` — a sage; and `Maharishi` — a super sage. These titles were given by the community of researchers based on the body of work or the insights one brought to the world — A complete meritocracy. The spoken insights of such sages were adapted into ‘rites’ by `Vyasas` — to disseminate and to preserve the knowledge. Rites were a foolproof method to embed these insights into public discourse.

Rites were conducted to invoke natural powers of the elements with human intelligence. For example, metallurgy and irrigation were outcomes of such rites. In essence a rite was a laid down controlled procedure that led to a specific outcome. Given the rudimentary level of knowledge, many things could go wrong. There were many unknowns because knowledge had yet not turned into ‘engineering‘. All the unknowns in a specific endeavour were symbolized by a ‘deity’ ‘Deity’ was worshipped to enhance the chances of success. Or to reduce the chances of mishaps. In a way, the faith in a ‘deity’ was nothing more than hoping for the best outcome. Hope remains a powerful driver to this date. Human journey is a journey of hope.

A rite known as `Dravya Yazna` was popular among rich and powerful. It entailed sharing homage with deities in return of speculative material gains. `Drvya` in Sanskrit, means material. Thus, `Drvya Yazna` literally meant the rites performed for material gains. For example a rite performed for more rain (by appeasing the deity of rain) was a type of `Drvya Yazna`. So was a rite performed to seal a wedlock with an expectation to have the happy matrimony last till death. The effectiveness of `Dravya Yazna` was questionable but the essence was to bring formal rigor of ‘research’ to the masses. It also well served another goal — to fund the research. 

The formalization of family rituals into `Dravya Yazna` — sanitization of space (`shuddhikaran`), holy fire (`Agni`), intonations in carefully perfected ensemble (`mantrochhaar`), the time and the place (`Dasha and Disha`), and the specific order of homage to various deities (`Aahuti`); served two purposes. First it became a formal auspicious way to celebrate certain life events — such as child birth, marriage, retirement and even death. Second, it created an interaction platform between the ones who were seeking a higher purpose and the affluent who hosted the rituals for material gains. After the rite, there used to be an abridged message read by the ritual maker, in local dialect, to explain the relevant scripture, followed by QnA sessions — more you ask, more you please the deity. 

The hosts got the satisfaction of pleasing the deities while the ritual makers got plush mandatory donations — grain, cattle, precious metals. A big share of donations went to the central congregation. The source of wealth for the congregation. Many millennia later, the model still works in India. The classical music is still learnt in `Gharanas` — a diluted version of `Ashramas`. Each with their own style of renditions. The singers graduated from a specific `Gharana` of classical music, say `Hindustani Sangeet` have a life long bond to their origins and a source of continued alumni support.

`Dravya Yazna` was a carefully thought out intervention to keep the society in certain checks and balances and to incentivize the ones who were dedicating their lives to carry forward the ‘pre-scientific’ exploration. The research was not limited to spirituality or meditation. It was well organized learning process that paved the way for scientific discovery in fields such as medicine, agriculture, irrigation, construction and many more. `Krishna` wrote later in `Bhagvad Gita` — a central piece of epic `Mahabharata` — that the idea of formalization of rituals in this format, was institutionalized by `Praja Pati`. Many religious accounts believe `Praja Pati` is a name for `Brmha` himself, who coded the basic laws of civilization and whose idea seven `Bramh-rishis` adopted as inheritance from father to son. Others believe `Praja Pati` is a deity responsible for administering the realm. Whichever point of view we may consider, the literal meaning of the word is self-evident. It means one who sustains the community. `Praza` means the subscribers of a system, `Pati` means one who takes care or owns those subscribers. 

`Krishna` wrote in chapter 3 of Gita :-

> Saha [along with] Yajnah [ritual of actions] Prajah [community of followers] Srishtva [having created], Pura [previously anciently] Uvacha [explained] Praja-patih [`Bramha` himself, or a demigod in Hindu scriptures responsible for administering the realm ];
>
> Anena [this way] Prasvisydhvam [having attained more prosperity] Esah [through this] Vah [they] Astu [stayed as] Ishta [desired things] Kama-dhuk [owner who enjoys his blessings].
>
> Previously, in the ancient times, `Prajapati` institutionalized `Yazna` — ritual of actions, and explained it to a community of followers. Practicing this as a framework to build new skills — mining, metallurgy, agriculture, trading etc. or adopting it as `Dravya Yazna` for public engagement; they all got their necessities (and niceties) and stayed satiated.

Rites were baked in reality. For example someone starting an agricultural season, would conduct a ritual that underscored the right methods of sowing seeds, irrigation and harvesting. Someone starting a business would conduct a ritual that emphasized the accounting principles. The ritual maker who officiated a wedding must be someone who deeply understood the responsibilities a couple was taking on when getting into a wedlock — the vows. And one conducting a ritual after someone's death must be proficient in making the grief easier — like a therapist. Since all such endeavour had a significant risk of failure, there was nothing wrong in having blessings of Godly deities on your side. Humility was considered a virtue and it remains so even in the biggest scientific missions to date. 


The craft of reciting `mantras` with an ascetic lifestyle purposed for a singular focus on diction, was called `Naad Yoga`. This `yoga`, like many others, must be practiced with a strict daily routine (`Bramhacharya`). The idea was to tune human body into the skill of understanding, memorizing and chanting by removing all the external material distractions. On the other hand, the devotion to exploration and research (in chosen faculties) was called `Nyaan Yoga`. The meaning of `Yoga` is to connect with, and to tap into our internal energy. A `Nyaan Yogi` would harness the inner energy in the pursuit of knowledge. A `Naad Yogi` would do the same for the purpose of rendition and expression. Both were complimentary to each other. There was no point in cumulating knowledge if it was of no use to the masses, or couldn't be preserved over generations. Similarly, there was nothing to recite if it didn't carry specific knowledge. Thus, `Naad Yogies` worked in close interaction with `Nyaan Yogies`.  The role of `Vyasa` was of utmost importance in holding these two streams of `Yoga` together. It was like a bridge between knowledge and expression. Hence, a very sought after title and one that needed dexterity in both. In a way `Vyasas` controlled the flow of information — somewhat like the editors of main stream media these days. What will go to public consumption, what remains in annuls of obscurity. With great power comes the conflict. Some `Rishies` wanted to make their work imperishable by committing it to a text format. But such attempts were doomed for the written language was not standardized. And writing tools were still in early stage of development.
