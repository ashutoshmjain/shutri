dimensions
Anything we could measure with senses is a dimension.
A dimension has two measures - Internal and external
  for example a point in a three dimensional frame of reference has three coordinates - x, y and z
  The same point must have its own width, depth and height. However miniscule they may be.
  The idea of three dimensional frame mandates that every thing in it - till it ceases to exist - must have three dimensions. 
  The measure from the frame of reference perspective is external. That from the points perspective internal.
As the point moves across the frame of reference, these dimensions change. Changes are quantized.
  For example when a particle moves along x axis externally, its own internal x dimension must fluctuate. It shall follow a wave pattern. A zig-zag motion. Because the point must make a path in the space.
We can attach millions of dimensions to a point. 
  For example weight is a dimension. Just like width or height. 
  Weight's frame of reference is hard to imagine for the three diemsional beings such as humans.
  Temperature is also a dimension. 
  Each dimension comes with a constant.
  Pi is the constant if the dimension that we are measuring is radius.
  Love is a dimension too. So is every single emotion. We just can't perceive their frame of reference. 
  In essence there are thousands of internal dimensions. But externally we can visually feel only three diemsions. Some dimensions such as weight or temperature , we may measure through instruments as they are NOT visually measurable. Thus we can't see their frame of reference.
  Getting to higher dimensions means we could see the frame of reference of thousands of emotions.
  And then there are emotions that are simply unknown to us. 
Thus there are three categories
  External visual or sensory perception - three dimensional
  Internal perception - hundreds of scientific indirect measurable things such as temp, weight, speed etc and emotional dimensions for which we haven't yet developed the measures - such as anger or love or energy.
  And third is set of all those scientific quantities and emotions that we have yet not discovered.
The motion in each frame of reference is qunantized the way it is for the length or bredth.
  Try to isolate length , bredth and heingh in your mind. 
  Think external lenth (x cordinate) increases with consumption of one quanta of x cordinate. And it reduces with ejection of one quanta.
  At the speed of light ejection of quantas get impacted
    How
  Same thing happens with heat or energy or emotions.
  We consume a quanta and we eject one.
  We remain same internally but our position changes in the frame.
This entire arrangement is called `Vishnu`.  The universe.

How do we perceive it and what we choose to perceive.
The perception is called `Siva`
